package clock

// This package contains an interface to abstract the provisioning of the current time to the system.
// This interface is used to explicitly indicate that obtaining the current date and time is an infrastructural component,
// and that it should be not be accessed directly. This has the benefit of allowing one to manipulate at will how the system receives time
// and vary this provisioning based on the system's environment for example.
// The clock package proposes 3 implementations out of the box:
// - `UTCClock` which is responsible for providing the current date and time of the system in the UTC time zone.
// - `FixedClock` which always returns a certain predefined date and time.
// - `OffsetClock` which returns the date and time of the system with a given offset.
